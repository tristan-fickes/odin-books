      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>It is the 31st millennium. Under the benevolent leadership of the Immortal
				Emperor, the Imperium of Man has stretched across the galaxy. It is a golden
				age of discovery and conquest. But now, on the eve of victory, the Emperor
				leaves the front lines, entrusting the great crusade to his favorite son, Horus.
				Promoted to Warmaster, can the idealistic Horus carry out the Emperor's grand plan,
				or will this promotion sow the seeds of heresy amongst his brothers? Horus Rising is 
				the first chapter in the epic tale of the Horus Heresy, a galactic civil war that 
				threatened to bring about the extinction of humanity.</p>
