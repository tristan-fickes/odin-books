			<p>The Great Crusade that has taken humanity into the stars continues. The Emperor 
				of mankind has handed the reins of command to his favoured son, the Warmaster Horus.
				Yet all is not well in the armies of the Imperium. Horus is still battling against 
				the jealousy and resentment of his brother primarchs and, when he is injured in 
				combat on the planet Davin, he must also battle his inner demons. With all the 
				tempations that Chaos has to offer, can the weakened Horus resist?
